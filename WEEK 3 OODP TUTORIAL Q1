    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    BankAccount account1("123456", "John Doe", 500.0);

    account1.display();
    account1.deposit(200);
    account1.withdraw(100);
    account1.withdraw(700); // Should not allow overdraft
    account1.display();

    return 0;
}

Output (example):

Account Details:
Account Number: 123456
Account Holder: John Doe
Balance: $500
Deposited: $200
Withdrew: $100
Insufficient balance. Withdrawal denied.
Account Details:
Account Number: 123456
Account Holder: John Doe
Balance: $600
